# MYOLIGHT™ General Purpose Electromyogram Capture Device

MYOLIGHT™ is a totally awesome and working General High-Density Surface Electromyography (HDsEMG) system developed as a prerequisite to the developer's graduation from university. 

This repository contains code for the embedded system and the host interface, the latter of which is in /Python Scripts/myolight.py.

Will write a guide on how to use it once its done.
